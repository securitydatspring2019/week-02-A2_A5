# Week-2 OWASP A2+A5

## What to Read

At first, it might seem like there are an awful lot to read, but totally it sums up to 10-15 pages only, if you distribute the readings among your group as suggested below, so just go ahead a start reading ;-)

#### A2
- Read the OWASP description for [A2](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A2-Broken_Authentication) (10 min.)
- Read about [credential stuffing](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Credential_stuffing) (5 min.)
- Read/skim some of the references given in [A2](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A2-Broken_Authentication). You should distribute the “readings” among your group, since one of the exercises for day-1, will be to explain what you have read, to the rest of your group.
- Make sure that you all read/skim (10-15 min.) the [Cheat Sheet related to session management](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet), since this is where we will focus our practical attacks day-2

#### Watch
If you prefer to watch/listen [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1iGRBG3PJ8) is short but still pretty informative

#### A5
- Read the OWASP description for [A5](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A5-Broken_Access_Control) (5-10 min.)
- Read/skim some of the references given in [A5](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A5-Broken_Access_Control). You should distribute the “readings” among your group, since one of the exercises for day-1, will be to explain what you have read, to the rest of your group.

#### Extra (watch)
If you have time, watch [this video (22.min)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94-tlOCApOc) for a lot of "broken authentication" examples
